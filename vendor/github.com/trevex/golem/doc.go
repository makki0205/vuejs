// Golem is a lightweight WebSocket-framework.
// it simplifies interaction with websockets by exposing an event-based system allowing
// easy prototyping of WebSocket-interaction. To achieve this a simple extendable JSON-based
// protocol is used by default, but custom protocol or simple protocol extensions are supported.
//
// For more general information, visit the wiki:

// Examples can be found in the example repository:
